## Project Overview

This project involves a detailed analysis of video game data, covering aspects such as game genres, release dates, ratings, sales figures, and platform distribution. The goal is to identify significant trends and correlations that might inform future decisions in game development and marketing.

## Methodology

The analysis was conducted following a structured methodology:

1. **Data Collection:**  
   - The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and imported directly into the Kaggle Notebook environment for analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Using visualizations (histograms, box plots, scatter plots) to reveal distribution patterns.
   - Performing correlation analysis and hypothesis testing to identify key relationships.
   - Conducting comparative studies across different genres and platforms.

## Tools & Technologies

The following tools and libraries were used in the analysis:

- **Python:** Primary programming language.
- **Pandas & NumPy:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook/Kaggle Notebook:** Environment for interactive exploration.

## Dataset Description

The dataset comprises a rich collection of attributes that provide detailed insights into video game characteristics. It includes:

- **Basic Game Information:** Such as title, genre, release date, publisher details, and summary.
- **Ratings & Scores:** Including metascore and user scores.
- **Review Metrics:** Multiple sets of review data from various platforms, covering numeric metrics such as negative, neutral, and positive counts, normalized scores, and total review counts.

This extensive column structure allows for a multi-faceted analysis of user sentiment and performance metrics across a diverse set of platforms and review types.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The analysis covers:

- **Descriptive Statistics:** Summarizing key metrics like averages and standard deviations for scores and review counts.
- **Visual Analysis:**  
  - Histograms and box plots to visualize data distributions.
  - Scatter plots and heatmaps to uncover correlations.
- **Trend Analysis:** Examining trends over time, across genres, and by regional performance.
